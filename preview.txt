In this preview, I have put together most of what I need to create the atmosphere that I am looking for. 
At this point, I have not recorded any of my own sounds, but instead have found usable audio source on the internet for most 
of what I need. I'll go through each of the sounds that I have added. In the background, I used an audio file containing the various
ambient sounds that are heard in a room. To further create a sense of immersion, I have added sounds of cars passing by outside.
The original clip for this had the car sounds close together, so I needed to cut it up in a way that sounded normal in order to have them
throughout the whole soundscape. I also have a sound of kitchen noises which I have attempted to make sound farther away but havent quite
gotten that right yet. For my TV sound, I found a clip from Avatar The Last Airbender and turned it into an mp3.
This clip eventually cuts out as an air raid siren begins to be heard in the background. This is all quickly followed by the EAS headers
that are surprisingly available for download on FEMA's website. At this point, I dont have any message associated with the EAS alert;
I plan to create them by downloading a text to speech program that can use the same voice that is heard in real EAS alerts. 
In addition to this, I need to really sync everything up so it sounds realistic. The core of my soundscape is yet to be recorded.
This is the interaction between the two roommates, which will be played by my friend Madi and myself. Once I get this recorded,
the soundscape should really come together, and will hopefully sound believable and not cringey
